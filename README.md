# Project #5. Decentralized Star Notary

This is Project 5, in this project I created the my first DAPP (Star Notary) and I was able to publish it to Rinkeby network. I used NFT (ERC721) to create my tokens. I also used OpenZeppelin implementations. Truffle framework has been used heavily in this project too. I used Mocha and Chai for unit testing.
